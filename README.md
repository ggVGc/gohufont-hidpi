Scaled up and manually edited version of [Gohu](https://font.gohu.org/). Currently incomplete and imperfect, but daily driven by myself on a 4k monitor.
A-Z, a-z, numbers and some special characters have been edited by me to be single-width, others are left scaled up and hence look fat.
At some point I may fix things up, and make a 28px version.


** Thanks and acknowledgments **
All credits to Hugo Chargois for creating the original Gohu font, which I have been using for over a decade now.
